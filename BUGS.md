- When i switch to another display on sway that has a different resolution
and then come back to current display and open a pdf i get a broken display
`Gdk-Message: 11:55:58.226: Error flushing display: Broken pipe`
- If the window is wider than the pdf and it puts a margin to center it then
the definition click is unaware of this and it thinks the pdf is on the right side,
like if it wasn't center
- in chapter "A wise attitude to the hindrances" in first paragraph the ordering of words is bugged
- DODbook, pag 3, going down in visual mode with ctrl+d stuck cursor in "generic" text
   - also happens immediatly on first page
