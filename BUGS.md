- When i switch to another display on sway that has a different resolution
and then come back to current display and open a pdf i get a broken display
`Gdk-Message: 11:55:58.226: Error flushing display: Broken pipe`
- If the window is wider than the pdf and it puts a margin to center it then
the definition click is unaware of this and it thinks the pdf is on the right side,
like if it wasn't center
