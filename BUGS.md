- When i switch to another display on sway that has a different resolution
and then come back to current display and open a pdf i get a broken display
`Gdk-Message: 11:55:58.226: Error flushing display: Broken pipe`
- If the window is wider than the pdf and it puts a margin to center it then
the definition click is unaware of this and it thinks the pdf is on the right side,
like if it wasn't center
- theres a bug on ```thread 'main' panicked at src/widgets/eyers_window.rs:627:40:
RefCell already borrowed``` but only when i pass trought the red letters in robburbea
- in chapter "A wise attitude to the hindrances" in first paragraph the ordering of words is bugged
