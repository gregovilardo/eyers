- Make it work in spanish also.
- go up and down with keys on definition popover
- make translation nicer
- implement number+gg
- implement also google api for translation (maybe also ask the key)
- local dictionary?
- marks
- anotations on selection: you press 'a' and a textbox appear so you can write 
in it, then ones save it the selection gets a highlight and you could be able
to open the anotation to see it, also go from anotation to anotation. (think about keys)
It would be nice to show how many anotations in total, and in each chapter a 
number with the count of anotations in that chapter (maybe later this).
With anotations also i want a command like /export (maybe add a console? or 
just let a letter.. think on it) that let you export to a markdown like this

```
"This is the phrase that gets an anotation" [PDFNAME.pdf | page 155]
This is the anotation, that could have something like $markdown latex$

"This is another anotation" ...
```

- favourite words?

- when moving to a new chapter the visual cursor stays on old page, it should change like it change with ctrl+d
- copy LaTEX
